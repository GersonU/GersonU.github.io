    <h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>I graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Club involvement included <a href="https://unlaero.space/">Aerospace Club</a> (division: <a href="https://unl-uav.github.io/">UAV IARC Team</a> ) and eSAB (engineering student advisory board). The goal of the IARC team was to build an autonomous UAV to compete in the International Aerial Robotics Competition. The goal of eSAB was to facilitate a relationship between engineering students, engineering RSOs(recognized student organization), and the college of engineering as a whole(faculty and staff).</p>
<h2 id="research-interest">Research Interest</h2>
<p>My research history shows that I&rsquo;m interested in UAVs, this first began when I was in networking class at the career center in high school. With UAVs I&rsquo;ve performed HRI studies and have helped advance the UAV IARC team. I believe that HRI research is important because autonomous systems are supposed to aid humans in many different challenges and domains. For the autonomous systems to do their designated actions, humans should be comfortable with them so that they can trust the autonomous system to perform correctly. HRI studies help autonomous system developers ensure users are comfortable with the system potentially minimizing safety risks. Although I&rsquo;ve focused on HRI research, I would like to shift my focus to the bioinformatics domain. I&rsquo;ve been involved with mBiTe which focuses on molecular and biochemical telecommunications. Here I began learning about some bioinformatics methods through the projects that I worked on. The goal of WetSpace is to model communication in a wet communication system. I would like to begin working on and performing research on biological problems by applying computer methods.</p>
<h2 id="work-experience">Work Experience</h2>
<h6 id="recent-work">Recent Work</h6>
<p>During my time at UNL, I worked as a undergraduate researcher at <a href="https://nimbus.unl.edu/welcome">NIMBUS</a> and <a href="https://mbite.unl.edu/">mBiTe</a>. At NIMBUS I worked under Dr. Brittany Duncan, where my main focus was HRI studies using autonomous UAVs. At NIMBUS I was able to expand my knowledge immensely. I learned about ROS, SOLIDWORKS, AmazonMTURK, and ADOBE creative cloud. At mBiTe I worked under Dr. Massimiliano Pierobon. With Dr. Pierobon, I worked specifically on a project called WetSpace, a cybernetic platform for wet information systems space analysis. I also helped maintain and develop <a href="http://wetcode.unl.edu/">WetCoDe</a> and <a href="http://paredox.unl.edu/">PaRedox</a>. With the mBiTe lab, I learned about full-stack development and wet communication systems.</p>
<h6 id="past-experience">Past Experience</h6>
<p>One of my previous positions was as a COVID drive-thru runner at Bryan Health. At Bryan, I worked with the drive-thru team to administer the COVID-19 test and prepare them for transport to the lab for testing. I learned to efficiently handle and package sensitive material while confirming PHI with RN. I enjoyed working with the drive-thru team because they were all passionate and dedicated to helping the community. I&rsquo;ve also worked two summers, freshman and sophomore, at MetroPCS in Miami, Florida. Here I got to practice my people skills and presentation skills as I was a sales associate. During these summers I was also able to gain a huge improvement in communication with various people. I worked at multiple stores in many different parts of Miami, in some I was able to just speak English to the customers but in others, my Spanish speaking skills were tested with a wide range of Spanish speaking cultures. Here I also learned how to multi-task very well as I was usually handling many things at one time with a customer, whether it be making a bill payment and telling customers about our current ongoing promotions or even giving an entire family an upgrade and giving them new phones as a promotion for a port from another company.  In the past, I&rsquo;ve also worked as a crew member at Qdoba. Here I was able to learn how to work as part of a team. I had assigned duties every shift and also coordinated with my co-workers to help with other duties. I enjoyed working at Qdoba because it was very fast-paced, if I wasn&rsquo;t serving a customer then I was re-stocking the hot-box/fridge or prepping necessary items for the next shift. I also enjoyed being given a large list of things to accomplish for every shift and challenging myself to get most of it done even if we were only expected to get it done on a very slow day.</p>
