<li>WetSpace - mBiTe lab, a website built to house multiple simulation platforms. A user can create an account and use simulation platforms created by the mBiTe team. WetSpace also adds functionality that is not available on each respective simulation platform.</li>

<p>Amazon Mturk study - NIMBUS, a website used to run an online study. This website is hosted on my CSE account and was used to run an online HRI study, this study is planned to be done in person soon. The screenshot cannot be posted due to ongoing study under IRB.</p>

<li>
<p>Beyond School Bells Hackathon - Participated in the Beyond school Bells hackathon and won the grand prize. Slightly different from a traditional hackathon, I developed a curriculum for a topic for students over the course of a weekend with the aerospace club team. Followed the theme of aerospace and developed a curriculum full of lesson plans and activities for all grade levels.</p>

<p>PX4 Simulation - Through the Aerospace club I built a simulation for PX4. This simulation uses gazebo, ROS, and a SITL of px4. In this simulation, you can simulate the flight of a UAV and use ROS to control the onboard PX4 (SITL) flight controller while viewing it in gazebo. This was built as one of the very first simulations of the UAV team, it has a couple of examples on the repository to give new members a quick start. You may view the code <a href="https://github.com/UNL-UAV/mavROS-Simulation" title="Github link for mavROS-Simulation">here</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Image Recognition - Currently working on an image recognition repository that will house the image recognition code for the IARC mission attempt. This repository uses OpenCV and tesseract to provide the location of objects. This is going to be implemented in C++ and will also be slowly built into a ROS package that will be added to our main ROS package for autonomous flight. You may view the code <a href="https://github.com/UNL-UAV/ImageProcessing" title="Github link for ImageProcessing">here</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sneaky Controller - Built a small program that controls the audio system in my shared living room with my roommates. Originally built so I could control the sound system from my phone since the controller was very small and often lost. Implemented using an ESP8266 NodeMCU, an IR led, and Arduino IO.</p>
